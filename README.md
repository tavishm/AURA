# AURA RASPBERRY  PI HOME

AURA  was built on Raspberry Pi. This home directory contains all the code for AURA, a senior care robot for senior citizens. This code was written by me about 5 years ago.  It can speak, listen, walk and follow around, follow voice commands, play music, be configured with an app, send emergency alerts and medication reminders.
